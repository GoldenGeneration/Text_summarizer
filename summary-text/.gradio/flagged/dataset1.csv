Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5,[34] capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing.[35] As of 2026, the Python Software Foundation supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, following the project's annual release cycle and five-year support policy. Python 3.15 is currently in the alpha development phase, and the stable release is expected to come out in October 2026.""[36] Earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates.

Python has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[37][38][39][40] It is widely taught as an introductory programming language.[41] Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.[42]

History
Main article: History of Python

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at PyCon US 2024
Python was conceived in the late 1980s[43] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.[44] It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[45] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Python implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[44] Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[46] (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus"".) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[47][48]

The name Python derives from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.[49] (See § Naming.)

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, featuring many new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[50] Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[51][52] It no longer receives security patches or updates.[53][54] While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.11), with the plus signifying (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]"," Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language .
